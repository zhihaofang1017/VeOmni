OpSlot: a lightweight dispatch point used in generated modeling code.

An ``OpSlot`` is placed at the module level of a generated modeling file.
At model-build time, ``_bind_veomni_ops`` resolves each slot to a concrete
kernel (or ``None`` for eager) via the global ``KERNEL_REGISTRY``.
Inside the model's ``forward`` methods, the pattern is a simple 2-line guard::

    if veomni_moe_experts_forward.use_non_eager_impl:
        return veomni_moe_experts_forward(self, hidden_states, ...)
    # original HF code below, unchanged
